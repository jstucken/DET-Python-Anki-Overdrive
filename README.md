# DET-Anki-Overdrive-Python
An Object Oriented interface for controlling Anki Overdrive cars with Python. This library was specifically created for DET use and was reverse engineered from <a href="https://github.com/anki/drive-sdk">Anki Drive SDK</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xerodotc/overdrive-python">xerodotc</a> Python library.


This code is dependent on bluepy, so it will only work on a Linux system.
