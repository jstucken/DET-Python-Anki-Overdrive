# DET-Anki-Overdrive-Python
An Object Oriented interface for controlling Anki Overdrive cars with Python. This library was specifically created for DET use and was reverse engineered from Anki Drive SDK and other similar projects.


This code is dependent on bluepy, so it will only work on a Linux system.
